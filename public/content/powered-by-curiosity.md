## How it all started

It all began with a Appa's Android phone and a curious mind. The vast online tech community became my playground, and soon, I was dismantling old gadgets with kitchen knives and my Amma’s tailoring scissors, much to her horror — just to see what made them tick

My love for electronics began with a school project where I worked with LEDs and motors. That fascination led me to small sensors and transistor. These electronic switch gave the endless possiblities. Then I got introduced to the Arduino world. It was super exciting — I was blinking LEDs, running motors, and connecting sensors using jumper wires and breadboards. I was happy just seeing something work, even if I didn’t fully understand how it worked inside. I used libraries, builded code with lots of references, and told myself, "Okay, this works. Good enough". But deep down, I knew I was just scratching the surface. I wanted to know how and why everything worked, not just what to connect or which code to run.

But everything changed when I joined my PG program in Electronics and Communication Engineering. That’s where I started learning things from the basics — how electrons move through a conductor, how they form current, and how current flows are controlled using materials like semiconductors. I learned how a simple PN junction creates a diode, how adding one more layer forms a transistor, and how transistors are the building blocks of almost all digital electronics. From there, it was like building a staircase: Electrons → Diodes → Transistors → Logic Gates → Flip-Flops → Latches → Registers → Memory units → control units → ALU → Microprocessors / Microcontrollers → Embedded Systems

Once I saw this path clearly, that small Arduino board I once played with started to look massive — not in size, but in the complexity it holds inside.

I also got to learn about communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C which I had used before without really knowing how they work. In college, I learned how they transfer data bit by bit, using signals and clock pulses, how devices sync with each other, and how timing and voltage levels actually matter in real-world connections. But wait, the software world didn’t want to be left out, I started learning programming langueages, its data structures and algorithms, and how they make programs faster and smarter. I understood how memory works at both the hardware and programming levels, and how complex systems manage enormous data efficiently. I also got into web development, building full-stack applications, designing REST APIs, and handling databases.

Learning all this gave me a completely new perspective. I stopped seeing circuits as just wires and components — I started seeing how everything fits together like a living system.

## Why This Blog?

Because I needed a space to collect it all.

I’ve been building, learning, and thinking so much, and this blog is where I bring those thoughts together. It’s a way to document what I do, track how far I’ve come. But more than that, I hope it becomes a space where others like me, the endlessly curious, the restless learners can feel seen. Maybe you’ll find ideas here or maybe, like me, you’ll just enjoy the process of figuring it all out.

I believe every engineer should keep learning, experimenting, and building. This blog is my way of living that belief — out loud.

Whether it’s a deep tech dive, a random thought, or a weekend project, I’m going to write it here.

Welcome to my journey.
